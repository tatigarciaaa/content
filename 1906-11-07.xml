                <p>The unrest throughout Morocco is increasing. A French Cruiser's boat was stoned whilst

                <head>Old Egyptian Industry.</head>
                <p>Paper Produced From Papyrus</p>
                <p>Enterprise Rewarded</p>
                <p>Success seems to have crowned the enterprise of Mr. Smedley Norton, the well known author and explorer,
                in his attempt to revive the papyrus-growing industry of Egypt, which has been extinct for over a thousand 
                years. A large tract of land is now under cultivation, and it is confidently believed that the result will be 
                the production of a better quality of paper than any yet on the market, at a much cheaper price</p>
                <p>So long ago as the seventh century papyrus-growing was a staple industry in Egypt, but through neglect the
                plant ceased to grow. What travellers on the Nile believe to be papyrus is nothing but Nile grass, which is quite
                useless for the manufacture of paper. Mr. Norton, who has explored Egypt successfully, obtained seed from remote
                parts of Syria and Palestine, principally from the vicinity of the Sea of Galilee and the River Jordan. Any
                endeavour to cultivate the plant there would be futile for commercial purposes, as there is no provision for
                the transit of the reed to the coast in adequate quantities. A specimen of the plant which was successfully raised
                on the Nile by Mr. Norton has been certified by Mr. C.B. Clarke, of Kew Gardens, to be the true papyrus,and after
                exhaustive experiments Dr. Querin Weirtz, consulting chemist and analyst to the Paper Makers' Association of
                Great Britain, has produced pulp which he pronounces admirable for paper-making, and remarks that its adoption
                is only a question of quantity obtainable, price, collection, and freight." </p>
                <p>All this has been carefully calculated. Mr. H.E. Winter, who is closely associated with the scheme, said,
                in an interview with a representative of "The Daily News"; "All the pros and cons of the matter have been 
                considered by a committee of experts, and the result has been under the level of the Nile. It has to be
                ploughed only once in five years, and that very deeply, so that, with cheap labour, the cost of production
                will not be great.</p>
                <p>"We shall have seven or eight hundred acres under cultivation at first, and shall be able to send over about
                100,000 tons of raw material in the first twelve months, commencing next Spring. To start with, we shall have it
                made into pulp in British factories, but later we shall have our own mill on the spot, so that the cost of freight
                will be considerably lessened when we export the material from Egypt in the form of pulp. Experiments have proved that
                the yield of papyrus pulp, after bleaching, is much larger than that of esparto pulp, and it is exceedingly strong.
                In the old days the natives used to make suits of clothes and boats out of the paper made from papyrus. We shall make
                paper for newspapers and books, and also for wall decoration."</p>

                <head>The English In Egypt</head>
                <p>Our Manners and Morals</p>
                <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette."</p>
                <p>Sir, -An interesting feature of the Press campaign now being carried on by our Nation alist opponents is the reiteration
                of attacks on our morals and our manners. We British are accused of superciliousness, discourtesy, and aloofness. Mustapha
                Pasha Kamel falls back on these accusations whenever at a loss of material. "Al Moayad" gives us a lamentable
                picture of young Englishmen standing pipe in mouth and trousers turned up at the ends, accompanied - horror of horrors - by 
                their dogs in the presence of Legislative Councillors, Ministers, and other grave and reverend seniors. In fact, we are accused
                of boorishness and arrogance at all times and season, and the good patriot who is zealous for the reputation of his countrymen 
                naturally feels pained that such accusations should be brought against them and apparently accept as being wholly true by the
                readers of many Nationalist journals.</p>
                <p>As far as I can gather, there is some ground for the assertion that the British and the educated Moslems of Egypt have to some
                extent drawn apart since the Occupation. But the fault is not all on our side, and in justice to our countrymen let me attempt to 
                explain their conduct.</p>
                <p>In many cases the young Englishman has no conscious bias against the people of the country, but his tastes, but interests, and
                his work lead him among his fellow countrymen, or at least among other Europeans, and by force of circumstances he finds it difficult 
                to meet any Egyptian Moslem, other than a bowab or a ferrash, and the former is probably a Berberine. He cannot spend much time in</p>
                <cb n="3"/>
                <p>studying the people his work is often sufficiently hard - especially if he is a member of that energetic commercial section of our 
                colony of which we are rightly proud - to make him hail with joy the coming of a few leisure hours which he can devote to bridge, games,
                or some form of exercise or to reading, to which he may be devoted. Be it remembered that the very knowledge of Arabic is no longer a
                necessity for many members of the colony. Commercial men have their clerks who can interpret Arabic or Turkish into English or at least
                French. Servants are learning pidgin English or Nilotic Italian in large numbers and even should they be innocent of a word of their master's
                tongue, it is parlous Arabic that one learns from the Berberine.</p>
                <p>Then there are those who consciously avoid intercourse with the native - I have nothing to say on behalf of some of them - their insularity
                is irreclaimable; they will have no traffic with any but true born Anglo Saxons - or ancient Britons - who, by the way, often boast strangely
                exotic names.</p>
                <p>Still these interesting survivals of days when ententes were undreamt of and foreigners qualified by sauguinary adjectives by the multitude
                must be decreasing in numbers. They are a dwindling band - they are out of fashion in days of Lord Mayoral visits and international flirtations,
                and we have to thank the national snobbishness for the certainty that the unfashionable will speedily pass away. It is a "good form" now to be 
                civil to foreigners, and John Bull to his amazement find that civility is appreciated. Being - in reality - very pleased to hear himself 
                complimented on virtues which he had thought were unappreciated by a hostile world, he grows more amicable every day and is indeed likely to
                suffer from his kindly advances to certian rather surly and jealous neighbours.</p>
                <p>But there are other who have reasons for their refusal to mix to any extent with native society, and their reasons may be summarised as
                follows :--</p>
                <p>"We are not anxious to pose as saints or to ride high moral hobby horses to the death. But what we have seen and heard of good Moselm 
                society, does not make us anxious to frequent it. Turks, Albanians and Circassians we like but they are rare and grow steadily rarer. The
                Egyptian Moslem of pure or mixed race has in our opinion two great weaknesses. He cannot as a rule be trusted to behave civilly to European 
                women. We grant that all countries have their Arries and their rakes but the Egyptian cad is unusually offensive. They neglect the good points
                in our civilisation, but wallow in its mire. Their knowledge and ideas of European women are based on their acquaintance with such poor creatures
                who have been driven by financial reasons to disreagard ethnological considerations. They do not meet respectable European women and their ways
                of thinking are not such as to make them desirable visitors to a European household. We think that it is too risky an experiment to bring the average
                Egyptian Moslem into our houses. We generalise - but we must generalise. We do not find the same weaknesses among decent Turks, Syrians, and 
                other Eastern races, Moslem or Christian. We know that the former, however low their opinion of women, can be trusted - that the majority of
                Eastern Christians know what home life is, and respect women in word and conduct.</p>
               <p>Again we find the extraordinary moral laxity of the people a deterrent. We out men who cheat at car is. We avoid gaol birds, we regard fraudulent
               bankrupts with aversion; even if the memory of former friendship or pity for the man who has gone under prompts us at times to continue our
               connection with him, we do not ask our friends to meet him. But here we find an amazing and phenomenal tolerance. We see a swindling mudir the 
               object of universal sympathy, we see gaol birds received on their return by their respectable friends with demonstrations of joy, we find ourselves
               introduced to worthies whore grue some record does not prevent their sitting on the divans of decent men. We know that the European adventurer is to 
               be found in Egypt, and we regret it. But we do not rush into his arms, nor do we hold that a man eminently respectable because he is rich. Such
               is one defence. We should of course be called canting hypocrites by the Englishmen who backed the Burghers against our troops and now support
               Mustapha Kamel. But we have our reasons, and there they are. No doubt there is some exageration in this indictment, but in the writer's opinion 
               it contains a great deal of truth. And what is the moral - well, that morals are wanted by the younger generation of Egyptians, as much as intellect.</p>
