                    <head>THE NATIVE PRESS.</head>
                    <p>We, have frequently criticised the political view* of the Nationalist Press,
                        and, we believe, in a tone marked by moderation and an absence of personal
                        warmth. We hare, whih differing from them in all general question*, at times
                        recognised that they had a certaii justification for their criticisms of
                        details oi governmental administration. The persons attacks often made on
                        British official* in theii column* do not appear to call for noleni
                        expressions of resentment or annoyance. The difference in ideas, in habits,
                        in training, and modea uf thought between them and their native critics are
                        au profound that uii*ur«. standings are inevitable, and we outsider tlu'.

                        attacked with the moat vulgar personal abuse, we feel a disgust which
                        require* expression. A* an instance what we mean we should like to cite an
                        article entitled 'The Fehmy Excursion, " which appeared in the "Minbar'' of
                        the 21st insL This artiete, which, we shall not advertise unnecessarily by
                        quoting verbatim, contains an eatremely uogrntle- manty reference to tbe
                        Prime Minister's ooo- ■tiluUonal delicacy, sod is concluded by an ode not
                        over-remarkable for good taste We cannot understand how writers wbo adopt a
                        loftily patriotic tone in their literary pr. ductiona can descend to the
                        extraordinary ungenUemanlineas of attacks of this character a man whose old
                        age and bUmeleas personal character should have been sufficient, had his
                        position in the State failed, to guard him from personal insult. But perhaps
                        there is no possibility of checking the resurgence, in the moat patriotic
                        Egyptians, of an almost barbaric coarseness in abuae, though it range that
                        the editors of "Al Minbar1 should have allowed their journal to coatein a
                        passage which no person of gentlemanly instincts could have written. Surely
                        the Nationalist party does not gain in dignity from these displays of
                        personal spite which, so far from alarming the foreign observer, merely
                        cause him to (hake his head at their bad teste and wonder whether there ia
                        any truth in the proverb, "II Maori yekhaf wa ma yekhtishish." (The Egyptian

                    <head>THE PORTE AND THE GREEK PATRIARCHATE.</head>
                    <p>During the last few weeks the Greek Patriarchate ha* been making preparations
                        to hold an (Ecumenical Council of the Orthodox Church in Constantinople, and
                        invitations to send representatives have been addreated to the Churches in
                        Syria, Egypt, and elsewhere. The project has, the •'Time*' Command nopie
                        apindent itatea, now (alien through in consequence of the opposition of the
                        Porte. One of the objects uf bolding the —wii was to consider the question
                        of the Bulgarian schism, and there can be little doubt that the Greek
                        ecclesiastic* intended to try to induce their fellow-Churchmen to adopt an
                        extreme anti- Bulgarian attitude. Tbi* would have been embarrassing to th8
                        Turkish Government, which, in any case, had no desire to see the council
                        assemble. The Grand Vixior, therefore, took steps which have mode it
                        imposuibie for the council to be held.</p>
                    <p>From this and other incidents it is thought that the Porte is beginning to
                        lose patience with the Patriarchate. The support which the Greek Bishops of
                        Macedonia cootinue to give the Greek bands, and which it now the greatest
                        obstacle in the way of the restoration of tranquillity,has been too
                        pronounced for the Turks to tolerate it, and the action of the Synod in
                        electing as one of its members the Metropolitan of Grevena, who is accused
                        by the Porte of complicity in the outrages of thg bands, ha* given especial
                        offence to the Grand Vixier. It is by no means impossible that the effect of
                        all this may bate produce s change the Turkish attitude towards the Bulga-
                        ,n Exarchate. "Indeed," says the correspondent, "I hear that the .Exarch may
                        be allowed to act upon the rights which were loog ago conferred upon him by
                        Imperial firman, but which he has hitherto been preen ted from enjoying. It
                        is possible that some arrangement of this sort was made at the interview
                        which Nejib Melhame had with Prince Ferdinand in the autumn. Nothing would
                        contribute more effectively to improvement than such a change of attitude of
                        the Po^te towards the Bulgarian national Church "A now believed to be
                        imminent."</p>
                    <p>'Although the idea of holding sn (Ecumeni- cal Council has proved abortive,
                        it is not without interest to note that there was a desire on the part of
                        some Greek prelate* to raise the question of s union of the Orthodox and
                        Anglican Churches. English clerical tourists bo have visited Constantinople
                        and have taken the opportunity to pay their respects to the Greek Patriarch
                        and other ecclesiastical dignitaries ha vecontrived to give the impression
                        hat there exists a strong feeling in England in favour o' this somewhat
                        chimerical project. Naturally enough, Greek Churchmen would hare been glad
                        to try to exploit this feeling forthe benefit of the Greek cause in
                        Macedonia</p>

                        The title is on sidered here to be an attempt to show the Saitan that the
                        aim of the Bryptian National ist Party is not only Anti-Baropean bot sino
                        Anti-Torkish, and that its object is to conple'e y sever the political ties
                        that bind Beypt to the Sublime Porte. </p>
                    <p> I was talking on the sabjaot only yesterday to a bigb Turkish official who,
                        I know, bas intimate saneations with Yildiz, and he told we that it was
                        considered most probable that the recent fraternization of Mastapha Pasba
                        Kamel with a seation of the advanced Ra diosl party in London slearly proved
                        that the "Patriot" was being infanced by the bitterent enemies of the Baltan
                        in Europe for it was this oliqne in Eagland who bad slways shown the most
                        fanatie bostility to his Imperial Majesty, and ware unremitting now in their
                        sudeavoors at mischief-making in Macedonia, just as they were in egging on
                        the Greeks to declare war a few years ago. He added that the political
                        siguificance of the choice which Kamel had made for the name of his
                        newspaper was quite well understood here, and that the Porte would not allow
                        the matter to pass opracognised, for such a pretended fervent sabjeet of the
                        Bultan to rise an independent symbol in Bgypt was nothing lers than trosson
                        to the Caliph </p>
                    <p> Whether these suspicions are correct, I havs no means of judging, but the
                        famoura ofloat on this matter are worth recording. Does Most.pba Pasba Kamal
                        think it worth while I throwing over the Baltas in order to preserve </p>

                        of polioy Kamel may be quite justified in raining the *Bgyptian Standard" as
                        siga of revolt against the pretensions of the Caliph in order to prove to
                        his supporters in London thist bis only objest in the welfare of Egypt, and

                        between the lines, and angar that the appropriation of a treasonable emblem
                        against the Baltan's 8-23rainty over Bgypt for the title of the new
