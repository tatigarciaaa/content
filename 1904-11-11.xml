                <p>Our telegrams to-day state that the Guildhall Speech has created a generally

                        means favourable to the British conceptions of the duties of belligerents
                        towards neurtals at sea. Above all, the question is asked, What will be the
                        attitude of the British Government in the event of the Tribunal finding
                        that, under all the circumstances, Admiral Rostjestvensky was justified in
                        the action he took. Such a decision would, it is believed, be received with
                        indignation at home and the hands of the Government would need to be
                        strengthened by the admission of the public of the existence of an
                        exceptionally strong Russian case in order to allay an excitement that might
                        readily bring us again to the verge of war. Even if the Tribunal decide in
                        favour of Great Britain, the ultimate pubishment of the guilty officers will
                        rest solely with the Government of the Tsar. The moment a decision is
                        arrived at the matter passes beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and it
                        is most improbable that immediate and adequate punishment will be meted out
                        by a Government convinced of the integrity and honour of its officers.
                        Another danger is that the Board of Trade inquiry, upon whosse decision the
                        British public will rely with perfect confidence, may conceivably be.
                        diametrically opposed to the decision of the International Inquiry. Such a
                        situation would be one of exceeding danger where the angry feelings of the
                        nation has been roused by an outrage of particular wantonness.</p>
                    <p>Lord Lansdowne was on firmer ground when he alluded to the cordial relations
                        with France. Who would have believed, even a couple of years ago, that in
                        the event of a serious difference between England and Russia, France would
                        be playing the part of a moderator, and using all her influence to keep her
                        Ally in the path of peace? That France has done this is unquestionable ; but
                        it is even permissible to ask if she has not done yet more. We have no right
                        to say positively, because we do not know it for certain, that France gave
                        Russia to understand, either directly or indirectly, that her sword would
                        not be drawn against England in a quarrel which was not of England's
                        seeking, and in which France had no concern except to prevent war if she
                        could. But, there are very strong grounds for the belief that France would
                        not have intervened against England , and that the fact was fully recognized
                        at St. Petersburg.</p>

                <head>THE ANGLO-FRENCH CONVENTION</head>
                <p>The Havas Agency publishes a telegraphic resume to-day of the speech of M.
                        Delcasse in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday. The Anglo-French Convention,
                        it will be remembered, consists of three separate decorations : the first
                        dealing with Egypt and Morocco : the second, with Siam, Madagascar, and the
                        New Hebrides : the third, with Newfoundland and West and Central Africa. All
                        points of the Convention have come in for a certain amount of criticism. It
                        is, indeed, clear that there are many Frenchmen who cannot easilt resign
                        themselves to the abandonment of that position of influence on the Nile,
                        which has been a persistent fFrench interest ever since Bonaparte (LINE
                        ILEGIBLE) That is quite human, and natural in men whose race combines the
                        sentimental with the practical in a degree unequalled, perhaps, elsewhere
                        than in France. Again, a compromise by which France abandons her historic
                        rights on the "French Shore" of Newfoundland undoubtedly severs, if with a
                        friendly hand, the last link in a long chain of historical associations. The
                        ghosts of the two hundred years of of international rivalry, of treaties
                        extending from that of Ryswick to that of Versailles, of the great struggle
                        for the dominion of the continent of North America, lurk in the privileges
                        of the French fishermen on the coast of Newfoundland. Nevertheless, business
                        is business, and Frenchmen know that well. Wherefore we do not doubt that
                        the majority of the Chamber and the Senate will adopt M. Delcasse's opinion
                        on the subject.</p>

                        assault a casual shell exploded in the Russian mines, killing and wounding

                        <p>Replying to the criticisms of M. Cochin concerning Egypt, M. Delcassé
                            said that it was in the interests of France that he took the
                            responsibility of signing the convention. He reminded him that the
                            Caisse de la Dette was created in 1876. Ten years later the interest was
                            reduced and the Debt unified. "We were nearing the time the redemin.
                            tion could be effected; must we refuse our aksent to the redemption of
                            the Debt? I did not think so, but I wished to get something out of our
                            assent. It is laid down that the receipts fromthe Land Tux will
                            bedevoted to the payment of the Domains Debt. Itis undeniable that this
                            financial arrangementis equally favour able to Egypt and to the
                            bondholders. The right of our directing the Antiquities Service is
                            recognised; the guarantee that nothing will happen to compromise our
                            schools is granted to us. I am therefore justified in saying that all
                            our intereste, moral and material, in Egypt are safeguarded."</p>

                <head>GOLD IN EGYPT.</head><p>NILE VALLEY OPERATIONS.</p>
                    <p>We have received the following information regarding the mining operations of
                        the Nile Valley Company, Ltd.</p>
                    <p>The company have erected a 250-H.P. Babcock and Wilcox steam boiler and are
                        at the present time also making use of an Evans pump capable of throwing
                        8,000 gallons per hour in No. 1. shaft. This pump is driven by steam
                        direct.</p>
                    <p>The machinery now in motion, or being transported to the mines, consists of 5
                        stamps, the nucleus of a 10 stamp Frazer and Chalmers mill, the stamps
                        weighing. 1,240lbs. It is hoped that the mill will be at work by the Ist of
                        February. A nine-inch Cornish lift is to be used in No. 5 main.shaft.</p>
                    <p>A level has been driven on a vein at 108 feet and follows the vein for about
                        1,100 feet. No. 1 shaft is in course of sinking on the vein to 200 feety
                        when No. 2 level will be driven, the depth reached at present being about
                        155 feet. The intermediate level is driven N..to S. from No. 1 shaft at 150
                        feet, proving the existence of rich strata. Rich visible gold has been met
                        with in several places along the 108 feet level in which level winges are
                        being sunk at about every 100 feet.</p>
                    <p>No 5 shaft is being stuffed to 13X5 foet and will be the main shaft. For its
                        present depth it is stuffed and timbered for about 140 feet. It will
                        hereafter be sunk to eut the vein at an estimated depth of 500 feet,
                        Crossents are being put in and driven to interseet the vein every 100 feet
                        from 200 feet downwards. The ore at sight and at grass ready for mill. ing
                        amounts to some 4,500 tons. Retaring to the 108-feet level, a winge has been
                        sunk close to No. 1 shaft to a depth of 30 feet, passing through some very
                        rich stone. Visible gold is still showing in the north face, a couple of
                        shots here a fortnight ago bringing down stone from which some £4,000 was
                        won.</p>
                    <p>The rich strake appears to be dipping north, and it is hoped that in the
                        course of the next few days it will be picked up in the interme-dinte
                        level.</p>
                    <p>Prospects are generally very encouraging for future work. Labour is abundant,
                        and on the whole very satisfactory as to quality.</p>
                    <p>Transport, both hauling and carrying, is entirely worked by means of camels.
                        'The company hopes during the cold senson to start work by diamond drill to
                        prove the eopper proposition at Absciel and to open up other old workings
                        known to exist on the concession. In addition, prospecting will be

                        which appears in another column. The cases of rabies among dogs in the city
                        are increasing to an alarming extent, and it behoves the public to assist
                        the Municipality in their endeavours to cope with the danger. Only last
                        week, we heard of a dog having bitten fice persons in one house in rue
                        d'Allemagne. One of the victims was Mr. L. Polity, of the Bank of Athens,
                        who has gone to Athens to be treated there.</p>
                    <p>We understand that as the system of poisoning dogs gives in some cases
                        unfavourable results, it has been decided to charge several members of the
                        police force with the duty of shooting all pariah dogs in the city. This new

                        The whole row of the third  tier was alinost exclusively occupied by the

                        raised the enthusiasm of the sudience to fever heat, the applause was
                        perfectly thundering and over-whelming. Mr. Nicolas Sinadino, the composer
                        of the piece, was repeatedly and enthusiastic. ally called for, and from a
                        box on the left he acknowledged the cheers by repested bows In general, all
                        the pieces executed were of a patriotie character, in connection with the
                        Greek nation, army and fleet, and it must be remarked that the observer
                        could not but be touched and impressed by the intense and sincere spirit of
                        patriotism which prevailed among the entire audience and offioers and men of
                        the fleet, and which was exprossed so repeatedly and spontaneously after

                <head>RABIES AMONG DOGS.</head><p>IMPORTANT NOTICE.</p>
                <p>The Municipality consider it very necessary to draw the attention of the public
                        to the fact that Rabies among Dogs is at the present moment greatly on the
                        increase. No less than four persons have died from rabies in the year 1904,
                        and of  these two in the last month.</p>
                    <p>As the Vete inary Service was not advised by these persons when they were
                        bitten, the dogs were allowed to remain at large. </p>
                    <p>Again, no less than 17 persons have been bitten to the knowledge of the
                        Municipality in the last 2 months.</p>
                    <p>It is most essential that anyone bitten by a dog, cat, horse, or any other
                        animal should at once advise the Veterinary Service of the Municipality
                        (Telephone 1150) so that the animal can be caught and the necessary
                        precautions taken.</p>
                    <p>It should be well understood that this should be done even though the animal
                        may appear to be in perfect health-for it is only by examination that it can
                        be ascertained if the animal is suffering from rabies.</p>
                    <p>The Municipality are determined to  do their utmost to remove this scourge-
                        but they are almost powerless unless assisted by the public.</p>
