                    <head>PORT ARTHUR.</head>
                    <p>The fall of Port Arthur brings to a close the first greet phase of the war in
                        the Par East, a phase that has been prolonged beyond all calculations by
                        Stoessel's obstinate and heroic resistance. The temptation to moralise is
                        almost irresistible. The ignomi- nious end of the great squadron of the
                        Pacific, the gradual crumbling of tho almost im- pregnable fortifications
                        are in themselves both a sermon on the vanity of human wishes, and an
                        illustration of what foresight and organisation can achieve when united to
                        discipline, to oourage, and to patriotism. But the practical and strategical
                        lemons to be learnednom this long siege ere of even greater interest to us
                        as a maritime Power, and they deserve to be studied the more caretully be-
                        cause of th' erroneous deductions to which the catastrophe of Port Arthur
                        may give rise. Because the valour of the Kussian soldiers sad sailors has
                        been in vain, and because the Russian Empire has suffered a humiliation to
                        which the capture of Sebastopol was as nothing, it has been suggested by
                        some authorities, end especially by the military correspondent of the Times,
                        that fortifications are themselves a delusion and a snare, that the harbour
                        of Port Arthur has been like a fatal magnet to the ships of the squadron,
                        and that Kuropstkin should have begun his campaign by withdraw- ing every
                        man and every movable gun from the Liao-tang Peninsula. In other words, Port
                        Arthur is claimed to have been what Metz actually was, and what Ladysmith
                        nearly became—a fatal entanglement, engulfing its own garrison, and finally
                        compromising the forces outside of it by robbing them of the power of
                        initiative. Had Stdessel got the gar- rison away while the railway was
                        unout, had Stark or Makaroff sailed off with the remnants of their fleet,
                        the abandonment of Port Arthur itself; the enormous lost ot material, and
                        the blow to Russian prestige, would have been more than compensated for by
                        the freedom which it would have given to Kuropatkin from his first arrival
                        on the scene.</p>
                    <p>Such an inference and such a teaching are, in our judgment, not only wrong,
                        but highly dangerous, as tending to discredit the value of naval bases end
                        garrisons to a maritime Power alike in peace and in war. They ignore the
                        faot that the misfortunes of the Russian Fleet have been due solely and
                        entirely to its own in- efficiency and to the incapacity of those who
                        directed its movements. The ruin dates from the first night of the war, when
                        the Japanese torpedo-boats were allowed to work their will, end it was
                        completed by the reluotanoe and inability of the blockaded squadron to give
                        battle to the adversary in open water. If the Russian Fleet had been bandied
                        as the fleet of a first-class Power ought to be, and as every country has a
                        right to expect from its naval officers, Port Arthur would have been an
                        absolutely invaluable asset to Russia during the war, and the march of the
                        Japanese armies on Manchuria would have been definitely delayed. A glance at
                        the map shows that Port Arthur is an ideal "point d'appui" for any nation at
                        war with Japan; and its importance can best be realised by the pro- digious
                        sacrifices which the latter Power has undergone during the process of
                        reducing it. Nor does it seem to be realised how much the prolongation of
                        the siege has actually affected the course of the campaign ; to say nothing
                        of the fearful loss of men, which will be felt more and more as the war
                        drags, it deprived the Japanese of the superiority in numbers which would
                        have turned the battle of Liao-yang into another Leipaic. And it has so
                        absolutely absorbed the energies of Admiral Togo that he has been unable-to
                        spare a single ship from his fleet of observation, even when the cruisers of
                        Skrydloff were ravaging in the home waters of Japan. Had the Baltic Fleet
                        been able to sail in the early summer, as Captain Mahan anticipated, the
                        Japanese com- mander would have found himself in the presence of a dilemma
                        which might well have proved fatal.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, the supreme importance of a well- fortified and well-garrisoned naval
                        base has never been so dearly indicated, unless we go beck to the siege of
                        Gibraltar in 1779-83. And the conclusion to ourselves ought to be
                        irresistible. Our own naval bases, to say nothing of minor ooaling stations,
                        are scattered over every see, and their retention at all ooists is the prioe
                        of our existence as a naval Power. Gibraltar, Malta, Siqaimanlt, Halifax,
                        Ber- muda, Singapore, Houg Kong, not to mention others, have each their own
                        port to play in any scheme of Imperial defence. They do not all require the
                        same sort of protection. Ber- muda, for instanoe, surrounded by its shoal
                        water, and guarded by its mine-fields, needs a garrison rather then big
                        guns. Halifax, with its rampart of the Atlantic surges, is practioally
                        immune from a torpedo flotilla. But they all have to be defended, if we are
                        to retain the power of sending our fleets securely from one part of the
                        globe to another, and it is essential that, one and all, they must be able
                        to guard themselves and their priceless stores of coal and material without
                        dependence on the Fleet.</p>

                            has caused a sensation in Germany. The papers are angrily demanding an
                            explanation. Some of them declare that Germany will now Work with
                            redoubled energy in order to increase her sea power.</p>

                            reported, and that what he said was that we must assume all naval powers
                            to be possible enemies. Owing to the growth of. such naval powers, our
                            possible enemies are more numerous than hitherto, and, consequently, we
                            have to keep an anxious eye not only on the Medi- terranean but also on
                            the North Sea. The "Standard" learns from Berlin that, unless

                        Cromer's au- dience, were so impressed that they have told me that they
                        intend to petition the Govern- ment against the manner in which liquor shops
                        are being opened everywhere in the villages without let or hindance. I
                        intend to found a local society hero to combat the alcohofic habit among the
                        natives. </p>

                    <p>They also visited the native <persName>Sefa Coulop</persName> school. Della

                    <p>A cairo correspondent writes:- to the west of Abdeen-square is a nasty
                        quarter where few sanitary and moral laws are enforced and where the
                        grossest criminality prevails. While in that locality today I learned that
                        in a quarrel between an armenian and three natives the armenian was so badly
                        beaten that he, after a week or more, died, and nothing has been done to
                        assailate or murderers. In fact, the principal was pointed out to me, and i
                        was informed that a seargant of police was bribed to strike this mans name
                        off the book for they all were arrested at the time of the quarrel. I wish
                        this matter to be inquired into, for it is a most gross outrage if it is
                        true as i am led to believe it is.</p>

                    <p><persName>Professor Felix's</persName> concert took place at the Khedivial
                        Hotel on Saturday night as an- nounced, and considering the wet and tem-
                        pestous weather, was well attended. We must congratulate the professor on
                        his courage in fixing a more modest price for the tickets than is customary
                        here for local artists, who ex- pect their kind friends to pay the same
                        price for the pleasure of bearing them perform as they would do for
                        distinguished artistes from Europe who can command audiences without the
                        disagreeable touting system in vogue in this country. Mr. Felix's selection
                        of piece was as it ought to have been, a happy one, as his silvery touch was
                        shown off to perfection in most of them. If there was one piece more than
                        another that elicited enthusiastic applause we might pick out an exquisite
                        Nocturne of Chopin's (Opus 15 No. 2), in which an oft-recurring melody
                        framed in flow mg cadenzas brought ont the pianist's remark able agility of
                        finger. Wagner's "Choeur des Fileuses" from his "Vaissean Fantome" arranged
                        by Lizt, was also much appreciated. Mr. Felix's wonderfully delicate touch
                        is not so well suited to the heavier German music, which requires greater
                        breadth of tone and a deeper sentiment. To our mind his conception of
                        Mendelssohn's "Fruhlings Lied" was quite incorrect and far removed from the
                        traditional one as taught in German Conaervatories,but on the other hand,
                        the Duo by the same com- poser was faultlessly played. </p>
                    <p>Professor Felix was ably supported by Mrs. Frederick Cree, who sang, first, a
                        romance by Giordano from Andrea Chenier with great refinement, and in the
                        socond part Beetho- ven's famous "Per Pieta." Her passionate rendering of
                        the presto, "Ah crudel I" quite carried away her audience, and on being
                        encored she repeated it with even more verve than the first time. We must
                        not omit the lovely little duet by Missa, "Les Roseaux Chanteurs,"
                        charmingly suug by Mrs. Cree and Mme. Felix, nor the instrumental trio
                        performed very ably by Mr. H. and Mr. L. Suzan accom panied by Mr. Felix.
                        Altogether a very plea- sant concert, but we must suggest that another time
                        the pauses between the items should be curtailed, and that a performer does
                        not ussually retire from the platform between two pieces bracketed a and b.

                    <p>H. M. S. ''Sealark'' arrived here from Sheikh Barghont on the 14th inst in a
                        damaged ion- dition, having struck a rock about 4 miles off Sheikh Barghout
                        whilst surveying. She had to come into Suakin for the necessery repairs,
                        which have now been carried, out with the aid of divers and material
                        obtained from the Sudan Government Railways </p>
                    <p>The "Sealark" after surveying here and at Sheikh Barghout, will probably go
                        into dock and then continue her survey as far as Australia, which is her
                        final destination. </p>
                    <p>The British S.S. "Dart" arrived from Eng- land on the 14th inst. with a very
                        largo con- signment of rails and fishplates for the Suakin- Atbara Railways </p>
                    <p>The British S.S. "Thornley" arrived from England on the 16th inst, with a
                        large consign- ment of iron sleepers for the railway.</p>

                    <p>Some foolish complaints have appeared in some of the Cairo newspapers in
                        regard to the allotment of the shares of the Egyptian Investment Agency,
                        Limited. This outcry is absolute nonsense, for the company has no concession
                        nor patents, and any one of the persons who consider themselves aggrieved in
                        not having been allotted shares, can start as many companies for general

                        <p>The Khedlvial Opera House reasserted itself in La Totea. The performance
                            was in every way excellent. <persName>Signora Pandolfini</persName>
                            obtain- ed and justified the welcome due to an old Cairo favorite both
                            by her singing and by her acting. <persName>Signor Girand</persName> was
                            pleasing and artistic, and Signor Polese was conspicuous for the
                            excellence of his acting; we could wish: that all opera singers would
                            give as much attention to details. "II Sagrestano" was amusing ; and we
                            should like to hear more of Sig- nor Sala, the "timbre" of whose voice
                            has some charm. Staging and choris were alike all that could be desired.
                            We trust that other performances will maintain this level, and do away
                            with the undoubtedly bad impression caused by Rigoletto (amongst Other
                            pieces given). We would say one word as to the orchestra. Though, it is
                            certainly composed of good musicians and directed by an efficient
                            oonductor, there is often apparent a certain want of judgment, which
                            might well be remedied, a lack of complete harmony with the singers,
                            This, in light opera, where the melodies for the chief performers are
                            the most prominent part, may not be so harmful in effect: but it is
                            fatal in any such opera as Tristan, or indeed in any piece where the
                            composer has devoted his attention to the music and not only to these
                            who execute it In a word, we would wish to find (and we-have a right to
                            expect) that sense of ensemble which it is the duty, as it should be the

                        <p><persName>Signora Isabella Sricher</persName>, the celebrated operatic
                            artiste, who created such a furore at the Verdi Theatre in Cairo, and
                            whose advent bad been anxiously awaited by a large section of the
                            music-loving public, made her debut at the Abbas helmy Theatre on
                            Satdrday Even- ing in Lucia di Lammermoor, and her magni- ficent
                            performance reached to the full the highest expectations which had been
                            formed regarding her. To say that Signora Svicher was admirable or
                            excellent, would be but to very mildly express the quality of her per
                            formapoe, from every point of view. Indeed, we venture to say that never
                            has Egypt before been honored by the presence of two such magnificent
                            artistes as Signs. Gemma Bellin- cioni and Sigus. Isabella Sricher, and
                            from the rapturous applause so lavishly bestowed by enthusiastic and
                            delighted audiences on each of these accomplished ladies, it is certain
                            that the season will be a successful one. Signa. Svicher's Lucia, on
                            Saturday, was an inter- pretation such as is seldom seen. Her singing
                            was certainly a revelation to many present, and herr acting was of a
                            high order and showed careful study of this mobt difficult rfllo. The
                            tenor, Signor Tomiaaui being unwell, the role of Sir Edgard was
                            sustained by Signor Pagani, who scored a distinct success. In fact, we
                            think we have never heard Signor Pagani to better advantage. Signor
                            Baldelli, in the small part of Raimondo, was excellent. The other minor
                            parts were in good hands and the orchestra and chorus were fully up to
                            their usual standard.</p>

                        <p>An admirable performance of Giordano's Andrea Chenier was given on Sunday
                            night. <persName>Signor Pagani</persName> was in splendid voice and gave
                            an excellent interpretation of the exceedingly trying title role. He was
                            the success of the evening. <persName>Signora D. Bassich</persName>, who
                            made her debut on this oocasion, gave a fairly good rendering of the
                            part of Maddalens di.'Coigny, but her voice is not robust enough to
                            stand her in good steed in an opera like Andrea Chenier. As Carlo
                            Gerard, the baritone Badini, who possesses a voice of delightful
                            freshness, was eminently successful. <persName>Sig. Montanari</persName>

                        <head>RIGOLETTO</head>
                        <p>Last night, a very excellent performance of Rigoletto was given at the
                            Abhas Theatre. Excellent, we say, because in every respect the
                            "ensemble" was a matter for admiration and, at times, even for Surprise.
                            In Rigoletto Verdi began to realise in a way which he hitherto had not
                            surmised, the important and extensive powers of his mind Up to this
                            point he had written many tunes which had been hummed and sung
                            throughout the whole world, but here he seemed to forego the enormous
                            spirit of tune that was within him, and to give himself up entirely to
                            the dramatic matter in hand. Last night's per formance of the opera was
                            eminently successful. Signora Svicher, in the part of Gilda, was from
                            every point of view a very great success ; her voice, which possesses
                            some of the most exquisite qualities of modern vocalisation, was proved
                            on this oocasion to possess an exquisite and, if one may use the
                            adjective in connection with singing, a shining quality that impressed
                            one enormously, by reason of the absolute purity of its evocation. Her
                            range is enormous; she never misses her effects, and, to sum up, we
                            regard her in no other light than that she is dazzlingly brilliant She
                            was frantically applauded, especially after her delightful rendering of
                            "Caro noms," which she was obliged to repeat Sig. Tomisani took the part
                            of the Duke and enchanted everybody by the magnificence of his singing.
                            He is a tenor of great power, and was in good form last night,
                            enthusiasm on the part of the audience following everything he did. It
                            stands to reason therefore that his rendering of "La Donna e mobile" waa
                            triumphantly successful. In the part of Rigoletto Signor Badini sang
                            excellently, though he did not impress us very much with his acting. The
                            other parts were in good hands. The chorus was at times disappointing,
                            but on the whole good, while the orchestra deserves credit. Tomorrow
                            night, Signore Ballincioni will appear in Fedora</p>

                        brahimish. </p>
                    <p> La Tribunal, adoptant les motifs exposés par F. W. Simond qui plaidait pour
                        la Crowa Brewery, a débonté les brasseurs de Munich de leur demande comme
                        mal fondée. </p>
                    <p>Les brasseurs de Munich avaient soutenu par l'organe de leur avocat, M. F. de
                        Duinreicher, qu'ils étaient en droit d'interdire à la Crown Brewery, de se
                        servir des dénominations: Bière de Munich et Bayrisch Beer.</p>
                    <p> Le Tribunal a retenu que quant à la pre. mière génomination, telle qu'elle
                        était employée par la Crown Brewery, soit : Superior Munich Quality, alle
                        oxolaait toute idée de provenance, mais désignait simplement une bière
                        resseinblant à celle de Munich, brassée et fabriqnée comme celle brassée et
                        fabriquée à Munich. </p>
                    <p> Que d'ailleurs la Crown Brewery avait offert par exploit d'huissier de
                        remplacer la dénomii. nation de Superior Munich quality par toute autre au
                        gré des demandeurs et notamment par celle de : Simili Munich, genre de
                        Munich. </p>
                    <p> Qu'au surplus l'étiquette employée par la Crown Brewery ne laissait aucun
                        doute et ne pouvait, telle qu'elle était libellée, induire le consommateur
                        en erreur. Que les mots Crown Brewery s'y détachant à première vue, et
