                        annuities where possible from 15 to 50 years, or even longer periods. The
                        sum required for this operation is reckoned at about eight millions
                        sterling, and it is said that it has been guaranteed by Sir Ernest Casual at
                        a rate equal to about 3 3/4%. As the rate of interest on the annuities is to
                        be 5 1/2%, the difference between 3 3/4% and 5 1/2% on eight millions will

                        Nicolason was most successful, as we thought, in the "Aria del Fishio," from

                        <p>The Golf Steward begs to remind members that the entries for Lbs golf
                            meeting dose at 12 noon to-morrow, 23rd inst. So far many members who
                            play golf constantly have not entered for any event. The Golf Steward
                            points out that the system of allowing the full handicap greatly
                            increases the chances of the ordinary or indifferent player, whilst
                            correspondingly minimizing those of the "scratch" man. He hopes
                            therefore that any long handicap players who are hesitating about
                            entering will now take the earliest opportunity of sending in their
                            names for some events. Aboukir Company.—Th e profit and lorn account for
                            1904 shows a credit balance of £23,049, which added to £2,780 brought
                            forward from the preceding year makes £25,829. The arrears of dividend
                            due on the ordinary shares to December 31,1903, amounting to 10s 10 3/4.
                            per share, were paid in January last, and it is now proposed to declare
                            dividends for the past year of 7 per cent on both the Ordinary and
                            Deferred shares, leaving £5,002 to be carried forward. Coal Imports.—
