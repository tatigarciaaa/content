                <p>General Nogi's second son was killed during the assaults on the 203-metre hill.
                    The elder son was killed at Manshan, and the General is now childless</p>
                <p>The Headquarters have published a further list of 36 officers killed and 58
                    wounded, presumably at Port Arthur.</p>
                <p>The disabling of the Russian fleet at Port Arthur having precluded the
                    possibility of it aiding the Baltic Fleet, there is a strong prob- ability that
                    the Japanese will rely on starvation instead of assault to reduce the fortress.
                    There was no sign of life on board the Russian vessels during the bombardment.
                    It was concluded that the bluejackets were taking refuge, or were engaged on the
                    land defences.</p>

                <p>The fall in copper has demoralized the stock markets here. A serious panic was
                    only avert ed by a narrow margin. It is believed that a powerful bear clique has
                    been formed to depress all stocks.</p>

                <p>IAN ALMANACK FOR 1905 We have received a copy of the Almanack published
                    annually by the Survey Department of the Public Works Ministry. The issue for
                    1905 is as carefully compiled as usual and contains a mass of detail on every
                    possible th subject connected with the Government of  that can be required
                    for reference. The new almanack consists of 108 pages, as com- pared with 100 in
                    1904 and 84 in 1903. Although a glance at the table of contents does not reveal
                    any new features of importance as regards general information, two very useful
                    pages of astronomical interest are added, and it is interesting to observe that
                    on the 30th of August an eclipse of the sun takes place which, as it will be a
                    total one in a part of Upper , will be an event to be remem- ay bered in
                    the lives of those who witness it, not on only in Cairo and Alexandria, but
                    throughout t's . Two partial eclipses of the moon take place in 1905, both
                    visible at Cairo. The table giving the rising and setting of the planets will be
                    useful to those interested in observing these matters, and if appreciated M. may
                    perhaps lead to further space being</p>
                <p>he devoted to astronomical information in the future. No change has taken place
                    in the price, which remains at 25 milliemes. Perhaps no other government in the
                    world can show a better example of spirited enterprise in this direction. We
                    know of no similar popular publication in England.</p>

                    several busi ness places have lately been opened here in spite of the prospect
                    of the port being transferred from this place to Sheikh Barghout. The merchants
                    still hope against hope that it will never come off, but I can assure your
                    readers that it certainly will. H. M. S. Sealark went to Sheikh Barghout last
                    week for surveying and sounding and the harbour and returned here the day before
                    yesterday. She reports that a great camp has been put up there by the European

                <p>CAIRO POST OFFICE.</p>
                <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE</p>
                <p>Dear Sir,-It is with the utmost reluctance that I address you on the Postal
                    Administration, but it is the only apparent way of effectively remedying the
                    negligence of the authorities in Cairo. On the 4th inst. a letter of great
                    importance was sent to me from Cairo. I received it the next evening. On the 5th
                    inst. I posted several letters in the evening; they were of a most pressing
                    nature. Of these, to my own knowledge, one of them was undelivered at 5 o'clock
                    p.m. this evening, and its non-delivery has caused the greatest con- fusion and
                    inconvenience. These letters were all addressed to residents in Cairo. As this
                    has happened many times, I cannot let this occasion pass without protesting most
                    bitterly against the careless way the postal duties are supervised and carried
                    out here.</p>
                <p>Another grievance is the great delay in the distributions. The authorities,
                    knowing a large mail is in, put up a notice that delivery will be made at "such
                    and such" a time. The delivery is seldom, if ever, made at the time stated. On
                    the 5th inst. delivery was notified for 6 p.m. but it was 6.33 before the
                    windows were opened. Result:- loss of time and incon- venience.</p>
                <p>I hope this will reach the eyes of the responsible official and that more care
                    and punctuality may be the result.</p>
                <p>1 am, Sir, "LETTERS</p>
                <p>Cairo, 6th December, 1904. [With regard to the allegations of given above, we may
                    remark that if our cor respondent had sent the envelopes of the letters in
                    question to the Cairo Post Office, the matter could have been brought home to
                    the responsible parties. As to the delay when a large mail arrives, this
                    entirely depends on the numbers of the letters arriving. The Post- master
                    General is very desirous that all irregularities should be made known to him,
                    but it is impossible to trace cases unless the complainants send the envelopes
                    with their complaint. It is obvious that in such a widespread organization and
                    in such a country as Egypt, efficiency is very hard of attainment, but no
                    official in Egypt has a higher ideal of efficiency than our worthy Postmaster
                    General. ED. E.G.).</p>

                <p>Jerusalem, December 6.</p>
                <p>On the 26th November a party of over twenty British Freemasons arrived here on a
                    visit, and on the following day they met in the quarries of King Solomon,
                    outside the Damascus Gate, which form a subterranean cave extending to about
                    half-a-mile under the city. During the meeting several resolutions were
                    enthusiastically and unanimously passed. Telegrams, conveying messages of
                    fraternal and respectful greetings, were dispatched to both his Majesty King
                    Edward VII. and to H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, Grand Master of the Grand
                    Lodges in the United Kingdom, to which the following reply has been received by
                    the Past Master of the late Royal Solomon Mother Lodge, 293, Jerusalem, who
                    attended the meeting at the request of the visitors and delivered a discourse on
                    the interesting site and its relation to Freemasonry "Sandringham, Nov. 30, 1904

                    already begun to patronize is this pleasant hotel. The new hall and the large
                    new reading-room are excellent. The y private sitting rooms and upper bedrooms
                    of re the hotel have been provided with covered balconies similar to those of
                    "Al Hayat," to me enable visitors to sit or recline in front of their ge
                    bedrooms. A hairdresser's shop, a pharmacy, a lllaboratory, and a bookseller's
                    shop have been me constructed, and a new dining-room for tourist e parties is
                    being built. The enlarged garden, d with the new terrace, whence a beautiful
                    view of the cultivated land and Cairo is to be enjoy ed, is certainly a great
                    improvement.</p>

                    delightful as ever, but we cannot help thinking that the part of Carmen suite
                    her better than Mignon. Sig. Baldelli sang very well indeed as Lothario. As
                    before, the staging was excellent. The chorus was perhaps less agitated in the
                    fire scene than we could have wished, but, as a whole, the performance was as
                    good as any we have heard yet at this theatre, and we seldom have the chance of
                    at hearing a tenor of such qualities and delicate tone as Sig. Tomasino even in
                    Europe,</p>

                <p>CRICKET.</p>
                <p>CAIRO. ALEXANDRIA.</p>
                <p>Play was resumed yesterday at 10.30 am. and Cairo started badly, losing Stout
                    with the score at 74. Capt. Potter continued to bat well, but at 87 he was
                    nicely caught by Dawson low down at third man. Matters seemed to be going badly,
                    but Wild and Graves in a long stand wore down the bowling, Wild's leg hitting
                    being admirable. Numerous changes of bowl- ing were tried, but the batsmen,
                    though both lucky in avoiding being run out, took the over to 165, when Graves
                    was bowled; at lunch-time the score had just passed the Alexandrian total and
                    the Cairo captain declared the innings closed, Wild being not out for a really
                    good innings of 71, which included 12 fours After lunch J. Maclaren and H. B.
                    Carver went in and hit very freely, punishing the Cairo change bowlers with
                    great vigor but taking few risks. In 40 minutes they scored 87, when Maclaren
                    was taken in the outfield. The rest of the innings was marked by H. B. Carver's
                    free hitting. He was very severe and Stout's bowling and kept the ball down as a
                    rule, and when the innings was declared was 'not out' for 108. He hit 17 fours
                    and gave no chance. Of the Cairo bowlers Stout had the best figures. Good
                    catches by Stout and Boyes deserve mention. With a balance of 182 against them
                    and the light failing, Cairo did not seem to be out of danger, but after 1
                    wicket had fallen for 11, Capt. Potter and Lockett wore down the bowling and at
                    the end hit very freely and well. Both were not out o at the close of play,
                    Capt. Potter making 41 and Lockett 56. Both played very good cricket indeed and
                    gave no real chance.</p>
                <p>The bowling was less effective than in the first innings of Cairo. The wicket
                    keeping on the Alexandria side was very good, both Mur phy and Dawson doing
                    well. For Cairo, Capt. t Potter gave a really first-class display of t keeping
                    to bowling that was at times wanting in accuracy and direction. Only 9 byes were
                    scored out of a total of 381 for the two innings The game was a very enjoyable
                    one and the weather on Friday excellent. Full score: ALEXANDRIA</p>
