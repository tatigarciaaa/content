                    <head>ALEXANDRIA MUNICIPALITY.</head>
                    <p>The Alexandria Municipality, as an international institution suitable for
                        such a city as this is, may be considered to be the best of the kind that
                        could be invented, for it combines all the essential drawbacks of a great
                        representative institution with none of its advantages. The municipal
                        councillors, who are elected on an extraordinarily limited and artificial
                        franchise, derive a great deal of importance from their self-allotted
                        duties. Most of them remain in Europe from the spring until late in the
                        autumn, and there is no obligation for them to attend to the ordinary
                        routine of their municipal functions. They enjoy an enormous privilege, for
                        they are quite free from public opinion, which is non-existent here, and
                        they rigorously prohibit the Press from being present at their meetings. The
                        reports of their assemblies are carefully edited and doctored before being
                        sent to the newspapers, and only rumours as to the real state of affairs
                        consequently leak out. With all its faults the Ministry of Public Works is
                        considered by business men to be far better to treat with than the
                        Municipality, and we have only to observe the progress which Cairo has made
                        within the last few years in order to form a comparison between the
                        efficiency of the two bodies. It is, however, ridiculous to complain of the
                        Alexandria Municipality, for in the nature of things it cannot be better, as
                        it is unreasonable to expect that a Municipality can be essentially better
                        than the city whose destinies it controls. Alexandria, in fact, does not
                        deserve a better institution, and if it bad more unselfish and
                        public-spirited members of the Municipality it would not know how to
                        appreciate them, but would so misinterpret their motives that they would be
                        forced to retire from public life in despair.</p>
                    <p>No better proof of the logic of our standpoint on this matter need be adduced
                        than to cite the proceedings at the recent discussions on the subject of
                        introducing fresh sources of taxation. At the penultimate meeting of the
                        Municipal Commission several propositions for fresh taxation were agreed to.
                        The most important of these was the impact on retail dealers of alcoholic
                        liquors, it being impossible to get at the wholesale dealers owing to the
                        commercial treaties. The week before last our Municipal Councillors, having

                        off the application of this tax until the Greek Kalends. There was no
                        genuine discussion of the reasons for the postponement of this most useful
                        tax, and the interests of a great city were cynically flouted on behalf of a
                        small </p>
                    <p>class of retailers who happen to enjoy votes. | There is no need to blame the
                        Councillors. After all they only acted according to their own lights, and
                        having no other ideas than t) be secure of their seats at the elections
                        fifteen months hence they naturally obeyed the orders of the
                        drink-retailers, who otherwise would have voted solid against them. They
                        would thus have lost their seats and been in all probability replaced by
                        more unsatisfactory persons. It is therefore ridiculous to criticise our
                        Municipal Councillors as we notice with regret that our local contemporary

                        ne finisse pas par s'émouvoir en ville de la situation actuelle. Les
                        questions municipales nous touchent dans nos intérêts immédiats, et lorsque
                        l'on verra qu'il n'y a pas à attendre de nos conseillers des décisions,
                        suivies d'une exécu. tion rapide, il se produira un mouvement tel que
                        l'institution, elle-même, en sera atteinte dans son essence, car
                        l'impuissance pour l'ac. tion sera la condamnation du régime international </p>
                    <p>Quand donc pourrons-nous écrire après une séance : la Municipalité a décidé
                        ceci ou cela et les travaux vont commencer dans quelques jours ! </p>
                    <p>Il n'est plus permis d'accuser l'administration ; celle-ci attend l'impulsion
                        du corps délibérant et doit être prête à la suivre. </p>
                    <p>Si on ne fait rien, c'est que les conseillers municipaux ne le veulent pas,
                        voilà ce que l'on sera bientôt en droit de proclamer. </p>
                    <p>In our humble opinion all such criticism is beside the mark. Neither the
                        Municipality nor its councillors can be more efficient than they are now, as
                        they must ipso facto be on a level with the city, and on the whole they are
                        quite as good as anything that Alexandria deserves. </p>

                    <head>CRUELTY TO ANIMALS. </head>
                    <p>There is a very serious discrepancy between the way in which the Mixed
                        Tribunals and the Native Court at Cairo regard cases of cruelty to animals.
                        This discrepancy is so startling that it deserves publicity, for it is a
                        scandal that there should be such a divergence between the points of view of
                        two different judicial systems working in the same city. From January 1 to
                        the 12th inst. the Mixed Courts in the Capital had 23 cases brought before
                        them of Europeans working old, wounded, and emaciated animals ; there were
                        four acquittals and nineteen fines of P.T. 5. But the Native Courts inflict
                        fines of P.T. 100 and P.T. 50 in such cases. Why there should be this
                        differ. ence we do not know, but it is sincerely to be hoped that the Mixed
                        Tribunals will follow the example of the Native Courts, and be in future
                        more severe. Even the latter are by no means as strict as they ought to be,
                        and there is a startling difference between the convictions in Cairo for
                        gross cases of cruelty and those in England. A man at home that works a
                        starved horse covered with whip marks would get a fine of £5 or a month's
                        imprisonment. Here, however, a fine of P.T. 5 or P.T. 10 is all that judges
                        think Europeans ought to pay. As the Courts persist in such a flagrantly
                        lenient policy, it is not worth while for the police to bother themselves to
                        bring the charges only to be made ridiculous by such nonsensical sentences.
                        When an Anglo-Egyptian veterinary surgeon officially states that "the animal
                        is starved, the wounds are old, and it is a gross case of cruelty," it would
                        be enough, we should think, to ensure the offender being fined P.T. 100 at
                        least. The Mixed Courts at Cairo do not appear to think so, and such an
                        attitude is most discouraging to the police, so that the sooner a more
                        draconian view is adopted the better. How can the Society for the Prevention
                        of Cruelty to Animals, which is doing splendid work at Cairo, be encouraged
                        when the law courts are so lenient ! Yet there is plenty of scope for it in
                        Cairo. It is by no means an uncommon spectacle to see private carriage
                        horses with pieces of skin torn off their flanks' by the hamess. Many of the
                        cab horses are overworked ånd underfed in spite of the rise of tariff some
                        months age. The worst cases of cruelty that can be seen in Cain occur where
                        building operations and taking place. There overloading is almost habitual,
                        and many horses have broken knees caused in starting or getting the carts
                        close up to the buildings to unload. Tourists, instea i of doing harm to the
                        natives by the indiscriminate scattering of backsheesh. might economise in
                        that direction and contribute to the Cairo S.P.C.A.</p>

                    <p>Whatever may have been done in other parts of Egypt for the wvlfare and
                        happiness ot our guests during the 'X-na* holidays Helouan can at least take
                        credit to itself for having provided most seasonable enjoyments for its
                        visitors. Ths Grand Hote', besides providing a firstolaas dinner in all
                        respects, commencing with turtle soup and finishing with good old English
                        plum padding, had also a farther treat in store. One end of the large dining
                        ball was illuminated by a beautiful 'Xmas Tree tastefully decorated and
                        lighted with electric lamps of different colours. At the close of the dinner
                        Dr. Hobson announced that the management had provided a further
                        entertainment in the form of a tombola, or Italian lottery. Each guest bad a
                        card given him containing certain numbers. Ths<hi rend="underline"
                        >ma</hi>itre d'hfltel "Joseph then called out the numbers from the tombola.
                        As soon as the possessor of a card had a complete row of five numbers as
                        called out he then had the tight to select a prise from a table covered with
                        a collsctioo of beautiful presents all nicely oonooalsd in appropriate
                        wrappers. As there were over 100 priiM every guest had the privilege of
                        present­ing a winning card and making his selection accordingly.</p>
                    <p>The collection of prizes was so numerous that space forbids our describing
                        them all, but we must congratulate Mr. Manuel on receiving a most beautiful
                        ladies' embroidered bolero. Lady Gilbert Parker was the early recipient of a
                        beautiful prize. Rev, Campbell and Mr Fildes vied with one another in their
                        race to be early at the tables, both receiving das rewards. Mrs Seligman and
                        party were very successful in their drawings. The members sf Countess
                        Karolyi's family constantly appeared to be very del ghted with the amusement
                        and were received with cheers whilst going to re caive their prizes.
                        Altogether a most enjoyable evening was passed We bear that a grand ball
                        will take place on the last day of the year, to see the new year in and the
                        old year out.</p>

                    <p>The services on Christmas Day were largely attended, the numbers at the 7 30
                        a m. service being nearly double that of last year. At the 11am. service
                        every seat wax occupied, including about 60 chairs which were placed in the
                        aisle and at the west end ot the church. The choir sang the "Te Deum" to a
                        setting by Rev E Vine Hall. The anthem was "Behold, I bring," by the same
                        composer. Two offertory sentences were song and the first part of the
                        service closed with the National Anthem. The Communion service was a simple
                        setting by the Rev. F A. Gore Ouseley, though the time was by oo msans easy.
                        The singing of the music was excellent, and did the choir credit. The two
                        soprano solos in the anthem taken by Miss Callender, and the playing of the
                        organ by Mr Heaton, were specially worthy of note.</p>
                    <p>The church and chapel were tastefully decor ated. Among those who sent
                        offerings of flowers were Mrs. Batobeller, Mrs. Callender, Mire Coates, Mr

                        responsible for decorating the church were Mesdamrs Eyre, Roberts, and
                        Algernon Ward, Misses Barwell, Dodd, Morrison, and Talbot, and Mr
                        Heaton.</p>
                    <p>The collections throughout the day were for the fond for the poor and

                    <p> ( PROM UUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT. ) </p>
                    <p> Loxor, Dec. 25. There are no occasions more likely to oppress 08 with a
                        painful sense of our shortcominge and want of knowledge than our first
                        visits to the wonderful and awe striking temples round about Laxor. Vainly
                        do we con our guide books and read long accounts of the insoriptions that
                        tell their bistory, and endeavour to commit to memory long stringe of
                        dimensions that ought to, but don't convey some inkliog of their grandeur.
                        No sooner bave we passed bevesth those heavy pylons and found ooreelves like
                        pigmies at the feet of stalwart statoes and mighty pillars than all
                        recollections of our former stadies fly from oor minds; and nothing is left
                        but the wonder that goch things should be, and that we also should be
                        allowed to be in such close proximity to them. If only the elements of
                        Egyptology could be taught us in our youth, perbaps we might in time become
                        reasonably familiar with the history of the great gods and rulers of Egypt,
                        ond might follow the telling of their deeds with some degree of
                        intelligence. Instead of which we stand amszd at the immensity of the
                        subject, our minds bent to the sigoificance of it, and our feat from
                        stumbling over the pitfalls of our ignorance. </p>
                    <p> I have often wondered why some enterprising person has not instituted a
                        series of lectures to be delivered on the very soones of interest in the
                        neighbourhood. Would some of the well koown professors on the subject
                        oondescend to take them each in turn and explain them on their very sites, I
                        take it that a vast number of people would be only too gratified to avail
                        themselves of tbe oppor tonity to garder the fruits of their learning;
                        wbereas now it is impossible to accept or remember a tithe ot the garbled
                        information which the ordinary dragoman is pleased to impart. Lactares at
                        home or even in Cairo are all well enough in their way, but they would gain
                        oonsiderably in value and popularity could they only be delivered on the
                        spot. A series which might be given daring ton days or a fortnight, and
                        which would ombrace the temples of Luxor and Karnak on one side of the
                        river, and that long series of marvellous tombs and coloasi and Theban
                        remsing on the other, would tempt many people to continue in the
                        neighbourhood, and would bring still more notoriety to the researches of the
                        exploration companies. </p>

                    <p>(From our Thxatrical Cdrrupundbnt.)</p>
                    <p>1 came in rather late in the 2nd act, after hearing the singing at
                        Sbepheard's and I wish ed I had s'ayed at Shenheard's. "Carmen" was really
                        just about as bad as it could be. The only relieviag feature* were Ml'e
                        Devilloy and M Fontaine. M. Fontaine, for once, seemed to have freed his
                        voice: it was clear and resonant, and without effort in the lower register.
                        Id fact, all his usual faults were, for onee, absent. Mlle Devilloy was
                        delightful, co sweet and true, and with such a charm in every note, that she
                        was encored, and we all wished Mioae'a were a big part instead of being only
                        secondary M&amp;ry as E*oamillo seemed to me very apathetic , I was told the
                        Toreador song was not by any mean* wonder fol. Mme Chaix Bonheur, of whom 1
                        had heard so much, was most disappointing, and far too melodramatic; her
                        voice wasn't pleasing at all: it was too coarse and masculine, as was indeed
                        the whole of her interpretation. The rest of the singers and the orcheatra
                        were al! at sixes and leven*. quite tuneless, out of time, often actually
                        singing false. The orchestra was just possible when by itself, but the
                        moment any singing began everything went wrong. I quite agree with "
                        L'Egypte'a " proposal to change them radically and entirely They evidently
                        have no spontaneity or responsivene**, and they play badly, and no amount of
                        bard work will improve them The result is that only the fdw good singers oan
                        do anything, and that by forcing them selves and rest on to the right note,
                        or oom promising on the wrong note. The others and 'he chorus have no chance
                        against such discordant apathy</p>

                        after discounting this artificial autbesissm ore must admit that there were
                        roally few faults in last night's "Bohfcme ;" there were email, but
                        annoying. In the first place, the one performer whose voice should never be
                        beard at all, the con­ductor, to wit, talked much too loud and much too long
                        , over tbs roller an.I in the noisier passages h s rounded tones were au

                        <p>The estimated figure* of the exports and imports of meroh ui'li** and
                            «pecis for the year 1906 are shown below together with the totals for
                            the last six years, as given by the Customs Returns</p>
                        <p/>
                        <p/>
                        <p>The large increase in the exports for 1906 is, of course, lae to the
                            abundant cotton crop and the high pricas ruling The upward move moot in
                            the import* is b*rdly leas remarkable, raising their value as it does to
                            a figure which ;* some 10 °; higher than that of 19o5 This notable
                            progress appears by the customs returns to be shared by nearly all
                            classes nt the import trade, the most prominent advance being in the
                            category of me'ahand machinery, which alone acooont* for 40 £ of the
                            total increase</p>
                        <p>In my Note last year I said "The fact that during the peat two years the
                            imports of mer ohandise and specie taken together have greatly
                            outbalanced the exports, notwithstanding the constant heavy charges for
                            the servioe of the foreign debt, oonstitutee a phenomenon that calls for
                            reflection. A readjustment in the direction of normal equilibrium must
                            come sooner or later, and, if we are paying for our imports with capital
                            provided by tbe foreign investor, the operation, though by no means
                            unsound at present, cannot be indefluitely continued.1' These remarks
                            were somewhat severely criticised by a portion of the local Press, which
                            was inclined to accuse me of economic heresy and pessimistic fore
                            bodings In tbe passage quoted above I was far from desiring to formulate
                            any economic theory, beretioal or otherwise, but tbe fact that tbe total
                            import* of merchandise and specie in 1900 amounted to L E 18,200,000 as
                            against L.E. 21,600,000 for export*, leaving a balance of LE 3.400,(00
                            in favour of export a while in 1906 tbe figures are, imports LE.
                            31,900,000 and export* LE 2*.500 0 0, showing a balance of over LB. 3
                            400000 in favour of import*, i* a phenomenon worthy of attention and
                            study Even if these figure* imply that Egypt has been paying for her
                            import* with funds advanced by tbe foreign capitalist, there is nothing
                            necessarily alarm ing in the fact, so long as tbe capital in qoes tion
                            is employed fur tbe purpose of remenera tive enterprise</p>

                            have prevailed during the past year ar* not such s« to furnish a fair
                            basis on which to form a definite opinion as to the precise effect of
                            this reduction In tbe first place, there were considerable accumulations
                            of stocks to be disposed of before tbe consumers could expect to benefit
                            by tbe reduction, and secondly, foreign market prices and freigb'e for
                            most of tbe articles were higher tbia year</p>
                        <p>Moreover, tbe state of tbj local market fur cattle and petroleum was
                            abnormal, owing to quarantine restriotions, and to the temporary
                            atoppage of arrivals of petroleum during the disturbances in Rneeia.</p>
                        <p>Judging, however, from the data before me. I am ino'ined to think that,
                            having regard to tbe recent rapid advance of prosperity, a ledoo tion ol
                            4% on article* of first necessity w 1! not be found, for the moment, to
                            have affected the consumption to any very great ex'enl, whatever the
                            final re.nits may be If this view proves to be correct, it may, at all
                            event*, be claimed for the measure taken last year that, while it
                            benefits the consumers, it also furnishes tbe Government with a fiaoal

                            <p>VENICE is a 5 hours jonrney by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                                delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay Th>* total absence
                                of vehicular traffic strikes one a* very strange , no horse, cart,
                                camage or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life
                                at every turn The approach the Venice from the Adriatic is unlike
                                that of any other sea |s>rt. The town seems to be gradually, like
                                Aphnslite, bom of the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of ruck,
                                but first the tops of Cum |>anilex appear above the horizon, then
                                slowly the whole ghtp-nng town rises like a fairy mirage out of the
                                calm lagoon.</p>
                            <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour
                                of the beautiful Italian lakes.</p>

                                quarter hours by tram by way of Monza .</p>
                            <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                                very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is
                                most enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a ehanning spot, then come <hi

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p><cb n="3"/></p>
                    <p>They are as follows:—</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp; O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp; O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>
