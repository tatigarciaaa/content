                    <p>The "Morning Post" publishes the following survey of the conditions
                        prevailing in Macedonia and the Balkan states : </p>
                    <p>Signs are not wanting that during the winter the Powers will have to keep
                        anxious. watch over events in the Balkan peninsula. The report of the death
                        of two Servian ex officers in a prison at Belgrade evidently discloses very
                        ugly business indeed. The two men were anti-regicides, one of them vers
                        outspoken. The report telegraphed roads like * fiction, covering a murder by
                        the persons in authority. This is a grave matter. There was in Sorvin very
                        strong resentment against the regicides, and the fact that King Peter did
                        not see his way completely to dissociate himself from them has prevented his
                        acquiring the heartfelt allegiance of the people of Servia. There has
                        already been too much persecution of anti-regicides, and this new event
                        cannot but arouse the feelings that have been smoulder</p>

                        Alexander and minst I those who have profited by their crime. No one. knows
                        this better than King Peter, who therefore feels himself weak when what the
                        country needs is a raler firm enough in his sent to have a clear pólioy. The
                        King, looking round for a 'stay, may hope to find it in Austria, and may
                        therefore adopt what has hitherto been regarded as the anti-national policy
                        of a pact with Austria, a coarse to which he may be the more easily impelled
                        because the commercial campaign waged by Austria for the purpose of reducing
                        Servia to submission inflicts real in convenience upon the inhabitants of
                        Servia. The misfortune of Servia, is not to have a statesman on the European
                        level who can take a broad view of affairs and see Europe as a whole,
                        looking at something larger than the cliques at Belgrade. For Servis has
                        great prog: pects that may be realised by patient. The time must come when a
                        King of Servis may be able to make his bargain with statesmen of Vienna, but
                        will come only to a Service that can wait as well as watch.</p>
                    <p>In Bulgaria things are not altogether healthy. The Ministry has gone too far
                        in the direction of repression, reaction, and ChanI vinism. To have
                        dismissed all the University professors, to have trumped up a ridiculous
                        Lawsuit against one of Bulgaria's best states. men because he is rich, and
                        to have given free rein to the Anti Hellenic passions that produced riots
                        and outrages in various parts of the country and have driven thousands of
                        Greeks out of the land is to have proclaimed to Europe that the Bulgarian
                        Ministers are not of the class from which Europe expecta statesmen to be
                        drawn. The best reply to the incursions of Greek bands into Macedonia would
                        have been for the Bulgarian Government scrupulously to have protected the
                        Greeks living in Bulgarin. Neither Bulgariang nor Servians seem to have
                        fully realised that the autonomies of all the Balkan States are
                        interdependent. If one of thein is absorbed by a Great Power the others are
                        doomed, for none of them is strong enough to stand alone, least of all
                        Bulgaris. The Greek states non are remarkable for intellectual shrewdness
                        and even for their liberal education. Bat they are one and all infected with
                        the tradition of an exaggerated Hellenism. Ever looking back to the past
                        they cannot reconcile themselves to the realities of the modern world. It is
                        trite that Pericles Athens was the home of an intellectual and spiritual
                        life richer than has ever been known since. It is true that Alexander spread
                        over the whole Fast a cul. tare derived from the best of what Greece bad
                        until then produced. But the Athens of Pericles and the Empire of Alexander
                        did not exist together, and could not have done. To-day neither the one nor
                        the other is possible, but the modern Greeks dream of reproducing both at
                        once, and over their dream they lose their chances of obtaining what is
                        possible. To have attacked Turkey in the epoch of M. Delyannis would have
                        been a fine thing if there had been in the Greek troops the spirit of
                        Leonidas and his Three Hundred; but to have attacked Turkey and then to
                        retreat without serious loss of life was farcical. The Greeks have to learn
                        courage and political temperance. Instead of attempting this they are
                        permitting their bands to commit outrages in Macedonia. Their excuse is that
                        the Bulgarians began it. It is the exense of barbarians, and is unworthy of
                        Hellenism in the sense in which Hellenism has any value or meaning to
                        Europe. For the Hellenism which takes Europeans to Greece, for which Byron
                        died and of which Shelley sang, meant the humanities in their best
                        expression. While Servia.is on the verge of anarchy, Balgaria in the hands
                        of reactionaries, and Greece given over to a spirit of barbarism, Roumania
                        under the firm and judicious guid. ance of M. Stourdza is endeavouring to
                        heal the wounds created by the agrarian rising of the spring. Roumania alone
                        of th four States has the advantage of men who stand on the European level
                        both in character and in intelligence. She needs them, for the
                        stratification of her society is a danger, and her rich absentee landlords,
                        superimposed on a peasant population living in conditions as bad as those of
                        the West of Ireland twenty years ago, furnish a problem hard enough to test
                        the powers of any statesman, however capable. The Turkish Empire, the
                        neighbour of these smaller States, is also in a condition that causes some
                        anxiety. The Sultan, able, car-seeing, and determined, has made himself the
                        representative of the reaction against European influence. He has carried
                        out with perseverance and without being hampered by any consideration the
                        policy of restoring to his Empire, particularly in Asia, its Mohammedan and
                        Turkish character. He has strengthened his Army. But in doing these things
                        he has found himself unable either to lighten the burden of taxation or the
                        system of espionage, and these two concomitants of his policy have estranged
                        his subjects from it. </p>
                    <p>In these conditions of the neighbouring lands theory of injured humanity from
                        Macedonia reaches the Great Powers. It is a piercing, a terrible cry, but
                        its tones are dimmed by distance Many voices join in its confusing sound.
                        There was at first the call of the rayah for just law and upright
                        administration ; for safety of life and limb and of honour, and for the
                        elementary rights of human beings. Then came the wails of those whoses homes
                        were burned, and their kith and kin murdered, bither by bands or the
                        irregulars who were supposed to chase them. There was an author. itative
                        anarchy in which Bulgarians killed Turks And Greeks, and Tarks, Greeks, and
                        Servants killed Bulgarians. The Powers intend that all this shall cease and
                        that lite and property shall be safe in Macedonia. But the reforms have been
                        obstructed and progress been too slow, so that there is as yet no guarantee
                        against fresh troubles that may spread over the whole peninsula. </p>
